# Movies Recommendation System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using various machine learning techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. The goal of this system is to recommend movies that align with a user's tastes, either by genre, ratings, or user behavior.

### Features:
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: The system recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggest movies that are similar to ones a user has liked, based on attributes like genre, director, etc.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines both user-based and content-based methods to generate movie recommendations.
- **Rating Prediction**: Predict movie ratings that a user may give based on their previous ratings.
- **Interactive UI**: An easy-to-use interface to explore movie recommendations.
- **Movie Database**: The system uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for movie and user data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the recommendation system.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Flask**: If applicable, for building the web app interface.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and working with matrices.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shuubhim/Movies_Recommend_System.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the recommendation system (assuming you are using a Flask or similar framework):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### How to Use:
- After running the application, open the interface in your browser.
- Enter your preferences or use the default settings to get movie recommendations.
- Browse through the recommended movies, view their details, and explore more suggestions.

### File Structure:
- `app.py`: Main script for running the recommendation system and the UI (if applicable).
- `movie_data.csv`: Movie dataset containing movie details.
- `ratings_data.csv`: User ratings data used to generate recommendations.
- `recommendation_model.py`: Contains the logic for generating recommendations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed for the project.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementing neural networks for more advanced recommendation techniques.
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Implementing a system that can update recommendations in real-time as users rate movies.
- **User Profiling**: Adding more features to profile users better for more personalized recommendations.
